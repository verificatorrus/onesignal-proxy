# ðŸ”› `onesignal-proxy` Proxy for OneSignal Web Push service on Cloudflare Workers.

Some users use ad blockers that block the domain name of the OneSignal Web Push.  
In this case, these users will not receive notifications and service worker not init on site (critical if you use additional service worker).  
This worker proxy requests from WEB users to OneSignal Web Push SDK backend via Cloudflare Workers and your domain name.

[`index.js`](https://github.com/verificatorrus/onesignal-proxy/blob/master/index.js) is the content of the proxy script.  
[`wrangler.toml`](https://github.com/verificatorrus/onesignal-proxy/blob/master/wrangler.toml) is the content of the proxy configuration.

## ðŸ’¬ We Want Your Feedback!

We're considering adding support for proxying Google Tag Manager and other analytics scripts.
